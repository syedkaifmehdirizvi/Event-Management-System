Event Management System
=======================
This repository contains a console-based application that I developed in Java for event management. This application allows users to perform various operations related to events and attendees. It is designed as a menu-driven application, providing functionality to list events, view event details, edit events, delete events, list attendees for an event, add attendees to an event, and delete attendees from an event.

Objective
==========
The objective of this project was to build a menu-driven console-based application using Core Java concepts based on a given scenario. By the end of this assessment, I was able to create a menu-driven application, handle data manipulation such as adding, updating, and deleting values, and implement core Java concepts effectively.

Scenario and Design
===================
The application is designed to handle event management. It consists of two main components or classes: Event and Attendee. Each event can have multiple attendees, so the Event object maintains a list of attendees.

The application provides the following functionality:

List All Events: Displays a list of all events in the system.
List an Individual Event: Shows details of a specific event.
Edit an Event: Modifies the details of an existing event.
Delete an Event: Removes an event from the system.
List the Attendees Attending an Event: Displays the list of attendees for a specific event.
Add an Attendee to an Event: Adds a new attendee to an event.
Delete an Attendee from an Event: Removes an attendee from an event.
As the developer, I have implemented a menu-driven interface where the user can select the desired operation from the available options.

Usage
======
Once the application is running, you will be presented with a menu where you can choose the desired operation. Simply enter the corresponding number for the operation you want to perform and follow the prompts on the screen.
